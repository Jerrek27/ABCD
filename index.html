          <strong>Introduction:</strong> Virtual Reality (VR) refers to the creation of a simulated environment using computer technology that can mimic real-world experiences. With the help of VR headsets, users can immerse themselves in a 3D world where they can interact with the environment. This technology has grown tremendously in recent years, impacting various fields such as entertainment, education, medicine, and even architecture.
